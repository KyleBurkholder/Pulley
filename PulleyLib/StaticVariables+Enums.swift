/**
 Represents a Pulley drawer position.
 
 - collapsed:         When the drawer is in its smallest form, at the bottom of the screen.
 - partiallyRevealed: When the drawer is partially revealed.
 - revealed:          Added by KB. Gives me a third open option.
 - open:              When the drawer is fully open.
 - closed:            When the drawer is off-screen at the bottom of the view. Note: Users cannot close or reopen the drawer on their own. You must set this programatically
